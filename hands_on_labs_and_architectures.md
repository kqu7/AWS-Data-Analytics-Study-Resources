## Architectures

**Note:** below are some blogs that demonstrate some real-life applications and integrations of AWS Big Data Services introduced above. It is better to read them after you have a basic understanding about the individual big data service. Also, many of the blogs include the step-by-step tutorial to help you go through the steps to replicate the results, which you can try out if interested.
