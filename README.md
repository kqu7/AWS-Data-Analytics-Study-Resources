# Overview üç∂:
This repository contains the resources I used when studying for [AWS Certified Data Analytics Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/?nc1=h_ls). 


# Table of Contents üå≥
## [White Paper](./whitepapers.md)
Whitepapers published by AWS for its data analytics services, including the general introduction, best practices, and anti-patterns etc,.   

## [Hands-on Practices and Architectures](./hands_on_labs_and_architectures.md)
To complement the introduction of AWS data analytics services, these labs and architectures provide opportunities to explore the knowledges learned in action.

## [Best Practices](./best_practices.md)
This section contains the best practices, collected from documentaions and blogs, for various AWS data analytics services. 


## [Concepts Check](./concept_check.md)
While learning the services myself, I found there were some concepts/tricky details that appeared while doing practice questions (mostly from WhizLab and Udemy), so I recorded them for the purpose review. This listing is not comprehensive, but you can probably use it for self-check.   


## [Other Resources](./other_resources.md)
This section contains various other resources, including the video courses, books, and exam tips.
